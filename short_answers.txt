Question 2: Streams in NodeJS:
Answer: There are four types of streams in NodeJS-
1) Readable: Readable streams are those from which you can read data. For example fs.createReadStream()
2) Writable: Writable streams are those to which you can write data. For example fs.createWriteStream()
3) Duplex: Duplex streams are both readable and writable. For example net.Socket()
4) Transform: Transform streams are duplex streams that can modify/tranform data as it is written and read. For example zlib.createDefalte()

Question 3: Event Emitter
Answer: In Node JS object emit events. For example fs.readStream emits an event when the file is opened. All objects which emit events are the examples of events.EventEmitter. Code example:

var events = require('events')
var event_emitter = new events.EventEmitter()

when event_emitter face any error, it emits error event. When a new listener is added, newListener event is fired and when a listener is removed then removeListener event is fired. EventEmitter provides properties like "on" and "emit". "on" used to bind the functions and "emit" is used to fire an event.
